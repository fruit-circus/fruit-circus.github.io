<div class="subtitle">For the last six months I’ve been volunteering with the Peace Corps in Zambia.
    <br>Here’s a little information about Zambia and my experience!</div>
<br>    


<br><button onclick="toggle1()">ZAMBIA</button>
<div id="zambia">
<br>Zambia is a large, landlocked subsaharan African nation that shares borders with Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, the DRC, Malawi, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Botswana and sits on a high plateau defined by the Zambezi River to the east and south, from which the country derives its name. 
<br><br>Until 1964 Zambia was a British protectorate known as Northern Rhodesia. (Modern-day Zimbabwe was Southern Rhodesia.) Zambia won its independence with peaceful protests while Britain was busy violently repressing its other protectorates. 
<br><br>Zambia is a massive country with dozens of different ethnic groups and over 72 different languages, most of which are not much more mutually intelligible than English is to German, for example. As such, Zambia’s national language is English, but very few people speak English natively, and many people living in rural areas only know enough to exchange a memorized greeting. The most widely spoken languages are Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga, Lozi, Lunda, and Kaonde. (Kaonde, or more properly Kiikaonde, is the language I’m learning.) 
<br><br>Zambia is rich in arable land and natural minerals, especially copper, but doesn’t have the industries to refine raw ore on a large scale. The current administration, under President Hakainde Hichilema, is trying to invest in infrastructure to refine copper so that Zambia can profit from its natural wealth. China has taken a great interest in the country, and in many other African nations, and is also investing heavily in infrastructure, in exchange for unrefined minerals.
<br><br>Hydroelectric dams supply more than eighty percent of Zambia’s power. Recent droughts have led to power shortages, and people have turned to charcoal as a fuel source, which is contributing to deforestation.
<br><br>The capital city of Zambia is Lusaka, and there are 10 provinces: Western, Northern, Northwestern, Southern, Eastern, Central, Copperbelt, Muchinga, Lusaka, and Luapua.
<br><br>Most of the country is very flat compared to North Carolina, but in the extremities of Northwestern, where I live (where Kiikaonde is spoken), there are a few mountains, and, in Northern province, there are impressive lakes and waterfalls. Sixteen kilometers north of my site is the Kabompo River, the second deepest river in Africa.
<br><br>In the dry season, most of the country turns yellow and dusty, but in Northern and Northwestern, plants stay green year-round. Southern and Western can be quite hot, according to volunteers there, even during the wet season, but, even in the middle of the hottest part of dry season, Northwestern is still fairly cool by high NC summer standards (although I burn much quicker). 
<br><br></div>

<br><button onclick="toggle2()">PEACE CORPS</button>
<div id="peacecorps">
<br>(pronounced “Core”) Peace Corps is a U.S. organization founded in 1961 by JFK. It sends volunteers to serve in developing countries where they work to build that country’s capacity, reduce preventable diseases, and foster international friendships.  
<br><br>The vetting process for volunteers is extensive, but the only real barrier to acceptance is not having a health condition which would make it impossible to live in an isolated, rural environment. Once you’re here, you’re kind of on your own. If you’re generally able-bodied, dedicated to helping others, and willing to do a lot of paperwork, there’s a good chance you’ll be accepted. While most volunteers are in their twenties, many people serve later in life; the oldest member of our cohort is in her sixties.
<br><br>The structure of Peace Corps in each partner country is slightly different, but always includes a medical office, safety and security, project sectors, and administration. Of these, only the administrative staff are American. In Zambia, those positions include the Country Director, the Programming Director, and the Management and Operations (Treasurer). ()
<br><br>In order for a country to have a Peace Corps presence, that country must both have specifically invited the Peace Corps and be stable enough to ensure the safety of volunteers (there is no Peace Corps presence in the DRC or Yemen for example; aid in those countries is the purview of other relief organizations.)
<br><br>Peace Corps is unique among the U.S.’s federal agencies because it is fundamentally separate from all the other agencies. Most government agencies are tied very closely to one another (), but Peace Corps is not () (why?) There is often an impression among urban HCNs that Americans are spies sent by the CIA, so Peace Corps works preemptively to mitigate this impression. If you have even so much as a family member who once served in the CIA, you will not be admitted(). My friend Madison and I stayed with a host-family in Lusaka during our training, and our host-cousin Blessing just texted me a few weeks ago to confide that, now that we’re both in Northwestern sending her pictures of our work with our communities, that she’s now pretty sure we’re not spies. She also admitted that she probably watches too many American action movies.
<br><br></div>

<br><button onclick="toggle3()">PEACE CORPS ZAMBIA</button>
<div id="pczambia">
<br>Today, there are about a hundred () Peace Corps volunteers in Zambia, which makes Zambia the country with the largest Peace Corps presence. () Before the pandemic, there were nearly two hundred volunteers. ()
<br><br>Peace Corps Zambia currently has four specific project sectors. These are: 
<br><br>RED — rural education development project. Volunteers teach English and work with teachers to improve student achievement. (I’m a RED volunteer! That’s why RED is the most important sector.)
<br><br>CHEP — community health empowerment program () Volunteers work alongside clinic staff on public health matters and community development.
<br><br>RAP — Rural Aquaculture Project () Volunteers work with interested communities to build sustainable fish ponds ()
<br><br>LIFE — Volunteers work with communities to plant trees and practice sustainable forestry () bees?()
<br><br>All of these types of volunteers serve for two years and come in waves of around 20. 
<br><br>Staff:
<br><br>Country director (CD) — Natalie Gill-Mensah recently replaced Tim Katz as country director. She’s pretty cool, but Tim Katz is a tough act to follow. 
<br><br>Simon Banda — Ba Simon is the program leader for the CHEP project. It’s not my sector, so I don’t know him very well. 
<br><br>Helen De Jonghe — Ba Helen is the program leader for the RED Project. She’s awesome. Under her are Winnie Funsani and John Nang’alelwa, who are also awesome. 
<br><br>Brenda Mwanza — Ba Brenda runs Monitoring and Evaluation. She’s the person we beg forgiveness from if we forget to submit our project data and the person we text last minute if we forget the difference between “Outcomes” and “Outputs”. 
<br><br>Chris Chiwela — Ba Chris was our training manager during PST (Pre-Service Training). He made sure all the special guests knew when to arrive and kept things moving along on schedule. Lesser training managers would have let days lapse into “Zambian time”, but not Ba Chris. 
<br><br>(By the way, “Ba” is an honorific, like “Mr.” or “Ms.” used in most Bantu languages. It’s a pluralizing prefix that also affects verb and modifier agreement. For example: in Kiikaonde “muntu imo” means “one person” “bantu babiji” means “two people”.)
<br><br>PPCs and PPAs (Provincial Program Coördinators and Provincial Program Assistants)
<br><br>The PPCs and As are in charge of volunteer safety within each province and manage the PRC (Provincial Resource Center). They’re usually wildly overqualified. Our PPA’s last job, for example, was ambassador to (). Because the country is so big, Peace Corps rents large bunkhouses in each provincial capital where the volunteers can hang out, report data (when the power is on and the internet works), and receive mail. It’s a nice place to step back into American culture for a few days every month. 
<br><br>After training together for 11 weeks in the capital, volunteers are sworn in and shipped out to their sites, where they have a three month period of community entry, after which they continue to live at site, but can take vacation days and receive friends and family. 
<br><br>Long before the volunteer’s arrival, Peace Corps staff coordinates with the community, holding meetings and preparing community members’ expectations about the capability of the volunteer, i.e. “The volunteer is only a community facilitator and will not be magically fixing all your problems with money.” 
<br><br>Before the volunteer’s arrival, Peace Corps also organizes with a well-respected family in the community who are appointed the “resource family”. My family is a few minutes’ walk away from my house, so I usually cook for myself, but I visit often. The little kids really like me, and the older ones get to practice their English with me while I practice my Kiikaonde. 
<br><br>When you are placed at site, Peace Corps provides a bike, a solar lamp, a water filter, and a box of medicine. For everything else, you’re given a small living stipend. Transport to and from site is done by standing on the side of the road, flagging down a bus, and being reimbursed later. 
<br><br></div>
  
<br><button onclick="toggle4()">MY SITE </button>
<div id="mysite">
<br>The old M8 stretches for miles in each direction. It’s an unmarked, two lane road occasionally plagued by potholes. Everything there is, except the farms, off in the vague north, is built around the road. If you follow it southwest, you’ll eventually come to the source of the Zambezi. It’s hard to define exactly where the village starts and stops, but the functional definition seems to be “which school do your children walk to?” If your children go to Kyawama Primary, then you live in Kyawama.
<br><br>If you walk away from the road in either direction for twenty to thirty minutes, you’ll find the farms. People have smaller houses there, where they stay during planting and harvest season. 
<br><br>My village has a well, two boreholes, several dozen churches, and some shops. There are a couple carpenters nearby, but almost everyone is either a farmer or unemployed. Even the carpenters are primarily farmers.
<br><br>My house is about 8 kilometers from the boma. “Boma” is a word from either Bantu or Persian origin meaning thicket, enclosure, or fort, nowadays almost exclusively used to refer to government district outposts. There is a widespread myth that boma is an acronym for British Overseas Military Administration, but it predates British colonial occupation by more than a hundred years. Other volunteers are usually much further from their bomas, so I’m lucky in that regard. I only have to bike about 25 minutes to get to the market.
<br><br>The shops in my village (small brick buildings with tin roofs) don’t sell anything I need other than eggs. They sell candy, hair extensions, pencils, gum, and other odds and ends. Although, in the small, non-perennial stalls there are often tomatoes, fritters, ocra, and dry beans. The price of a pile of four tomatoes is five kwacha (about 0.17 USD). One egg costs three or four kwacha.
<br><br>In the village, people’s houses are made from large, soft bricks and have tin roofs held down by nails and bricks. There are also outdoor huts for cooking (kinzanzas) which have thatched roofs, sometimes with tarps over them if they’ve sprung a leak.   
<br><br>My site has a long history with Peace Corps and seems to have benefited quite a bit from previous volunteers (Thirteen years ago, a volunteer named Jordan planted moringa trees, Mike helped fund a maternity wing, and (I think) Jennifer started a GLOW (Girls Leading Our World) camp. As far as I can tell, there were six volunteers before me, putting Peace Corps in this specific village as far back as 2008, if all the volunteers served consecutive two year periods, with a two year gap for Covid. Other volunteers in my cohort are the first or second at their sites. I am the seventh, and, unfortunately, final. Due to budget cuts, no more volunteers will be sent to Northwestern, and the PRC will be shut down. The six of us that will remain in Northwestern will still be able to take vacation days, but it will have to be at a lodge. “Woohoo!” said nobody, because this was not good. The rationale for pulling out of Northwestern is that mining has increased in Solwezi, and mining brings both development and crime.
<br><br>That being the case, I’m happy that my community is pretty well-off in a lot of respects. We have a clinic, two boreholes, a women’s group (called GEWL. I don’t know what it stands for), and lots of mango and Moringa trees. The main challenge (and why the community requested a RED volunteer) is education. The Peace Corps Rural Education Development Project Rationale says it best:
<br><br>“Zambia has made impressive economic progress over the last 20 years, and is now classified as a lower-middle-income country. Nonetheless, it has struggled to equip a largely young population (almost half the population is under 15) with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to build the economy and the nation in the next generation, especially with HIV/AIDS, which has been endemic for more than 20 years.
<br><br>With English the official language, English language and literacy play a key role in building the future, yet only 2% of the population speak it as a first language, and some, especially in rural areas, never acquire English. The Ministry of Education's current Revised Curriculum establishes English as the medium of instruction from the 5th grade on, while literacy in the local language should be firmly established in grades 1-4. In fact, children often appear in the 5th grade with minimal English or literacy skills.
<br><br>The Peace Corps Zambia Rural Education Development (RED) Project places Peace Corps Volunteer English teachers where they can best support pupils and teachers in the difficult transition from local language to English as the medium of instruction. They are assigned as English teachers in rural upper primary schools grades 5-9.”
<br><br>This rings more than true at my site. In fact, many 8th graders struggle to recognize certain letters and read short CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words (like cat, top, or bell). And, even when they can read the words, they rarely know what they mean, even going into 9th or 10th grade. My goal is to improve literacy, both in English and in Kiikaonde, and to introduce more effective teaching practices.
<br><br>A subsection of that goal is to build a library.  Progress is slow, but I’m excited. 
<br><br>Another subgoal is to increase the amount of available literature in Kiikaonde. Right now, the only physical books in Kiikaonde here (that I’ve seen, I’m sure there are others) are school textbooks and the Bible. There are also Kiikaonde stories online, and I’ve seen a handful of other published works, so our library wouldn’t be starting with nothing.
<br><br>Kids love to learn, but the education system is based on old ideas and comprised of teachers who are ill-equipped to deal with the needs of an overcrowded classroom. Parental attitudes are generally hands-off, and kids don’t get a lot of meaningful guidance with homework or practice time for English. 
<br><br>English truly is a foreign language, but is often used by teachers at a near-native proficiency level as the language of instruction. Concept-checking practices are clumsy and lead teachers to believe that students understand the material, when really they haven’t processed a single word the teacher has said. Teachers will plow ahead through the curriculum rather than slowing down to make sure students are on the same page. On top of this, teachers beating and smacking kids is a regular occurrence and seen as the only way to get kids to respect authority and pay attention. 
<br><br>A typical lesson involves a teacher copying down text and pictures from the textbook onto the blackboard and lecturing while students copy down the lesson content into their books, occasionally being asked to repeat the last word the teacher has said. After the students are done writing, the teacher erases the board and writes a related exercise from the book before leaving the room for about 20 minutes. The students complete the exercise, sometimes working together, and their books are marked by the teacher. I’m not yet sure if this grade is actually recorded anywhere other than in the student’s notebook, but it doesn’t matter, because no one is checking individual students’ performances outside of major tests. Attendance and assessment performance is kept purely for the sake of the District Education Board Secretary (the DEBS), who occasionally checks in to make sure everyone has their papers in order.
<br><br>When I first arrived, and my resource family brother Francis showed me his notebook, I was really impressed. It was full of pages and pages of information on things like the refractive index of water, how to write and send a letter, the geography of Zambia, and how thermometers work. I found a few errors, but was genuinely impressed. Then I found out that even though he can slowly sound out most of the words, he doesn’t actually know what they mean. The English word “temperature” was as far beyond him as “hot” and “cold”. 
<br><br>While these are the failures of the education system, there are also many dedicated, intelligent, and kind teachers working tirelessly for their students’ sakes. While as a whole the system may be geared to produce good numbers rather than educated students, the actors within that system, at least as evidenced by my school, are generally positive influences.

<br><button onclick="toggle5()">CLIMATE, FLORA, AND FAUNA</button>
<div id="climate">
<br>Most of Zambia is Very Flat, and Northwestern province doesn’t buck that trend (unless you go up into Mwinilunga). Northwest is mainly comprised of forests of short trees and grasslands. Most trees reach no more than 30 or 40 feet.
<br><br>The most notable feature of the landscape are the 10-20 foot tall termite hills that dot the landscape. These are enduring structures, typically built around tall trees, which last for decades. 
<br><br>Often have moss 
() more research 
<br><br>The forest floor consists of grass, earth, or smooth soft stone. The understory is very navigable, unlike the bracken and laurel hells of the Blue Ridge.  
<br><br>In Early December:
<br><br>The stars are bright at night, and you can occasionally see the dusty impression of the Milky Way on the clearest nights. It starts getting colder after about 9:00, almost enough to put on long sleeves, but my house stays warm until 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning even with the windows open. 
<br><br>The mornings are nice and cool, and a breeze runs through the mango trees that reminds me of fall. On sunny days the house becomes too hot to occupy without a fan pointed at my face starting around 10:00. At night there are moths (), termites (nswa), and the occasional firefly (kinteemu-nteemu) (). Houseflies are abundant during the day and retire at night. I’ve been able to prevent most of them from getting in my house by being quick with the door. But one time I left it open for a few hours to aerate while I was painting, and the delineation between inside and outside quickly became meaningless and remained such for three or four days until the flies succumbed to the insecticides woven into my mosquito net.
<br><br>The roof creaks when the sun hits it, heating it up or when a cloud passes over, cooling it down. 
<br><br>There are a variety of songbirds, and some of them sound similar to certain birds from North Carolina. There aren’t as many pied crows here as there are in other parts of the country. Chickens roost in the trees at night to avoid becoming prey to roaming dogs, who are few and far between, but always near-starving. People make the trees accessible to the chickens by cutting branches or placing ladders. Sometimes people have domestic ducks and turkeys. 
<br><br>Dogs are rare in my village, but common elsewhere. There are a lot of goats and cows; sometimes there are pigs. All the animals are afraid of humans, because humans can throw rocks. Mosquitos are fairly rare during this season compared to the city. Country mosquitos are smaller and quieter than city mosquitos. 
<br><br>There are wall spiders (which hunt mosquitos and are therefore allowed in the house), large black millipedes, various fuzzy caterpillars, cockroaches, and various other kinds of spiders, (which are not allowed in the house). Overall, insects don’t appear in overwhelming proportion.
<br><br>Constellations:
<br><br>Orion is the only constellation I recognize. In December it reaches its apogee at midnight. Directly overhead and sideways, it looks more like a second grader’s attempt at a rectangle than a mythical hunter. I tell people it’s a kibanda, they don’t seem to have a name for it.
<br><br>In January:
<br><br>Heavy rains and cloud cover make it nice and cool, sometimes throughout the entire day. But watch out! Snakes like warm dry places — like your house. Mice are extant. They are very small and fast, but not invincible to brooms and empty peanut butter jars. 
<br><br>Cooler weather keeps the flies down. (Despite two different people telling me that this is the worst season for flies, and that they’re fewer during the dry season.)
<br><br>When it rains, people stay in their houses. Goats also don’t like getting wet and will sleep in the entryways of churches. 
<br><br>On one cool January night, millions of pacific dampwood termites crawled out of the ground and swarmed the skies by the hundreds of thousands. They’re very easy to catch, since they swarm to electric lights, so people will harvest hem by the hundreds, grabbing them by their transient wings and dunking them in a pot of water. After being cooked, they have a gritty texture 
<br><br>In February
<br><br>There’s a nice cold rain every 2-4 days. During a very heavy rain, the sound on the roof is deafening and I wrap a blanket around my head. No dampwood termite swarms since the big one. Watermelons suddenly appeared in markets on February 5th. Sounds of occasional distant dog confrontations. Second bout of colds and sneezing — for two or three weeks almost all the children have runny noses and nasty coughs like they did in November. Been teaching them how to cover their sneezes. Little frogs chirp in the grass after rain where water pools on the grassy plains, crickets chirp when it’s cool. There remain a variety of bird calls, most often at the crepuscular hours. Often cloudy throughout the day. The guavas are ripe, but small and seedy. Stars are rarely visible at night due to cloud cover. Orion is directly overhead at 8:00. 
<br><br>Golden orb weavers have appeared en mass in Solwezi, clustering in little neighborhoods. They’re huge, but docile. 
<br><br>I saw a fairy. It was bright red and fluttering upright with silly little antennae. 
<br><br>I saw a black bird with a red heart and a tail four times as long as its body.
<br><br>In March 
<br><br>The same, but starting to go longer between heavy rains. Every week and half now if we’re lucky. Still very cool. 
<br><br>March is apparently large cricket and fruit fly month. Orion is overhead at 7:00, and lists quickly to the side and behind the black silhouette of the trees within a matter of hours, leaving only unfamiliar constellations.

<br><button onclick="toggle6()">VARIOUS CULTURAL TIDBITS </button>
<div id="culture">
<br>Church — Basically everyone is Christian, although there is a small mosque north of the boma. Holidays are celebrated either by day-drinking or going to church (and in this way are no different from any other days, except by size). Church services here are similar to services in America, but probably longer, and with no definitive start time. Usually, people trickle in from 9:00 to 10:00 while the pastor preaches in Kiikaonde with Biblical English bits sprinkled in. The choir sings, accompanied by drummers (or keyboard and electric guitar at bigger churches), and the congregation joins if they know the song, but are otherwise silent and stone-faced. There’s usually a special song for passing around the collection box(), and another song that’s very energetic, where some people ululate. The choir usually does a few songs with a simple dance or clap. (I’ve sung in the ECZ choir a few times and I can generally either sing or dance, but not both at once.) Songs are all in Kiikaonde except for “hallelujah!” and other Biblical interjections. At ECZ, men sit on the right and women sit on the left, the choir is mostly women, and the drummers are men. The drumming pattern is usually the same well-practiced pattern. Church administrators give some brief announcements after the singing, and after the service, senior church women serve lunch to certain people. I’m not sure how the subsection of people who get lunch is determined, but it weirdly always includes me.
<br><br>ECZ is fairly mild, compared to a few of the other shows in town. One day I followed some random women to a church called Rising, which was just in the fifth grade room at the school. There was some sort of faith healing thing going on and ten or eleven people spun into wild trances and fell over. I gradually snuck closer to the door and left after about four hours. 
<br><br>Hierarchy — In addition to a federal government modeled after Britain’s, Zambia also has traditional chiefs who decide civil cases and allot land and resources. Under the chief are the headmen. Headmen also decide civil cases like divorces and inheritance disputes. 
<br><br>Spiritual practices — Christian missionaries in the last hundred and fifty () years were unable to stamp out all the local culture, and although many stories and traditions have been lost or forgotten, various beliefs and practices persist. One of these is the belief in witchcraft, accusations of which are quite serious and can lead to preemptive violence or de facto exile. Witchdoctors are well-respected individuals who combat witches, and who can cure disease and divine a person’s guilt or innocence, among other things. There’s also ghosts. I don’t know much about this.
<br><br>One interesting event I’ve heard people talk about is the coffin carrying ceremony. If someone has died of an unexplained or sudden cause, the men carrying the coffin may find that they are suddenly seized by an invisible force that pulls them along in a forced march towards the murderer’s bed where the coffin falls and becomes unmovable.
<br><br>Another interesting thing I’ve heard about are the Jikishi dancers at boys’ coming of age ceremonies in the woods to the north. I don’t know anything concrete about Jikishi yet, but from what I’ve heard from adults and seen in children’s drawings, I have assumed three things. Jikishi imitate the cries of spirits, they carry ritual implements, and they wear a mask shaped like a beak. You’ll be the first to know when I find out more.
<br><br>Children’s drawings — Children draw in a surprisingly consistent way and draw a surprisingly consistent array of objects. Most people, adults included, whose drawings I’ve seen tend to copy from pictures rather than attempt to draw from life. 
<br><br>Clothing — Clothing is largely what you would expect to see anywhere, with the exception that most women wear chitenge skirts (in Kiikaonde it’s called kitenge, It’s possible that some varieties of Kiikaonde had more initial “ch” sounds a hundred years ago, based on some old texts I found, but today, all those words start with “k”.) Chitenge is patterned, waxed cloth with many uses, which is usually used as a skirt or wrap or used as a sling to carry a baby. Chitenge is definitely one of the top five most important cultural things in Zambia. If there are two takeaways from Zambian culture it’s probably nshima and chitenge. Paired with chitenge are usually T-shirts, often graphic Ts with cultural references or figures the wearer is not aware of (Elsa, Tupac (), the Chicago Bulls. I don’t think anyone here has seen Frozen, but they might have heard a Tupac () song. Once I saw someone with a UNC Chapel Hill shirt. He’d never been to America.) Most T-shirts have text in either English, Japanese, or Chinese; this also applies to other technology: busses, signposts, backpacks. Men mostly wear t-shirts and long pants—jeans, sweat pants, or dress pants; shorts are seen as immature, but they’re not uncommon. There’s a very wide-spread brand of blue high-vis work jacket that’s popular as well. Young girls often have colorful beads braided in their hair. Headscarves are fairly common. Earrings are uncommon. Almost no one wears glasses. A handful of women have straightened or dyed hair, most often red, although dyed hair is slightly more common in urban areas. For formal occasions, people wear suits and long sleeves, button-ups, polo shirts, or nice dresses. Shoes vary from fancy dress shoes to sneakers and crocs. Sometimes women will have matching outfits for church on Sundays, chitenge with the church name, for instance. When going to school, most kids wear school uniforms, but sometimes a plain white shirt will suffice. Most schools’ uniforms are either blue and white or green and tan.
<br><br>Phones — Many people have smartphones, but brick phones are more popular. 
<br><br>Sweeping — People sweep their houses and yards every day. Children are in charge of sweeping the dust in the front of the school, carrying away leaf litter and trash, and cutting the grass. At the same time, plastic trash and other litter is not usually disposed of in any meaningful way. Everyone drops trash wherever they are. 
<br><br>Parent expectations — I don’t want to say that “child labor is normal here” but there’s not much of a premium placed on children as vassals of the future. Children rank lower than adults in a slightly different way than in America; they’re expected to do a lot of difficult chores from a young age, like farming or carrying water. It also seems that most parents don’t find it important to teach their children things (that I think are important). (Like counting, letters, stories, and songs.) Children from families who do value their child’s education absolutely blow all the other kids out of the water in school. At the same time, someone is keeping them all fed, clothed, and giving them lollipops, so one shouldn’t say they’re unloved, they’re just prioritized differently. 
<br><br>An interesting set of examples comes from my resource family, who are fairly well-to-do. The oldest child, Kezhia (at 25), is very well-educated, speaks enough English to understand me if I tell a long story, and loves literature. Her favorite book is Animal Farm. As we descend in age, the children are less and less literate and speak less and less English (as is expected, since English is not spoken at home). When I was helping Francis, the third youngest (at 14), with his times tables, he would constantly turn to his parents for help with difficult questions who would just give him the answer that I was trying to make him work towards on his own. This impulse might help explain why many of the older students, and many adults, can’t do basic addition, but I need more data. I also don’t have a direct comparison to an average American 8th grader’s ability for mental math, other than that I’m pretty sure they know what negative numbers are and have memorized at least some of the times table. 
<br><br>My neighbor Hilda keeps shooing away the kids that congregate in my kinzanza (with threats of violence) but, similar to chickens trying to get into a big pot of nshima, they never actually go away. Today a big group of them were gathered together and Hilda was waving a big stick around. They looked like a children’s choir, so I walked up and started conducting them through the national anthem while she looked on hopelessly.
<br><br>Names — Names usually follow the pattern: English first name, Traditional last name. My neighbor’s last-born was just named Mildred. Wrinkly baby Mildred Mulando. Some of my eighth graders names are: Esther, Moses, Hope, Dave, Katoota, Jones, Naison, Mildred, Event, Christabell, Reffer, Forstina, Barbara, Sandra, Bibusa, Buwame, Monica, Mishek, John, Jacob, and Dorcus. Other interesting names I’ve run into include: Philosopher, Anxious, and Obvious.
<br><br>The ground — No one sits on the ground without a little stool. 
<br><br>Hand washing — Washing your hands before a meal is obligatory. You eat with your hands, by taking a small chunk of nshima and rolling it into a ball and using it to scoop other food. 
<br><br>Weight — When I got back from Lusaka my friend Mr. Nshimbi complimented me by saying I was fat. This was a compliment, although other volunteers have said that when they’ve tested it out on Zambians, they’ve been offended. 
<br><br>Hair styling — Boys’ hair is always short, but there are lots of really cool and creative hairstyles for women and girls. Other than clothing, this is definitely one of the biggest means of personal artistic expression. 
<br><br>Termite Dirt is a Tasty Snack — Termite dirt is a tasty snack. Termites make tunnels with dirt and now it’s termite dirt. According to my friend David, “It tastes like dirt.”
<br><br>Totems — Within tribes there are also lineages called clans or totems (mikoka). Individuals from within these lineages typically don’t intermarry. There is the Nyoka (snake clan), Nyuki (bee clan), Matembo (wasp clan), Mvula (rain clan), Njovu (elephant clan), and the Boowa or Kyowa (mushroom clan). There’s also the Baboon clan and the Mukowa. I believe there are others, like ants and lightning. 
<br><br>Being Visibly Foreign — Being visibly foreign is an incredibly strange thing to be and lots of people will want to talk to you about it.
<br><br>Whistling, hissing, or shouting “You!” are normal ways to get someone’s attention on the street. If you have light skin, a normal way for someone to get your attention is by shouting “muzungu”. 
<br><br>I’ll admit, I’m also intrigued when I see foreigners here too, but I’m not so astounded that I simply must holler at them and ask for five kwacha (0.17 USD), ten kwacha (0.34 USD), or for them to marry me.
<br><br>People don’t shout “muzungu” at me in my village so much anymore, because most people know my name, but it still happens a lot on the road to the boma. (Side note: more children know my name than adults. Kids I’ve never seen before know my name. It’s really cute. They love me. All of the adults I regularly interact with know me pretty well, most people in the village know my name, but others, especially approaching Commerce Row don’t recognize me or don’t seem to be interested in me.) (Which is a relief.) (I love it when people don’t care that I’m there.) 
<br><br>If I’m on my bike (i.e. not in my village, but on the way to the boma) I don’t typically respond to these hails. But if I have the energy, sometimes I’ll surprise them by greeting them in fluent Kiikaonde (50/50 that they actually speak Kiikaonde, if they don’t they’ll say “Ok, ok, ok.”) or I’ll look around really confused and say “what!? Where?!”. People have yet to find this funny, but I have faith. One day.
<br><br>What Tribe are You? — People assume a lot of things about America, most notably that all Americans are white, to the extent that they don’t believe non-white volunteers are American. You also might be asked what American tribe you’re from. I explain that most Americans don’t have a tribe, although we do have lineages. Then I explain that there was a time hundreds of years ago, before white settlers colonized the continent, when all Americans were members of a tribe, and they lose interest. 
<br><br>Are You Married? — Especially for women, there’s a cultural expectation that you should either be married or want to get married by your early or mid-twenties. Even after clarifying that I’m 25, I still get asked how many children I have. 
<br><br>Bedtime — people generally go to bed by ten, and rarely are any voices heard beyond eleven, but once I heard a group of people singing at two a.m. I did not investigate.
<br><br>Stories — () ye ka mama
<br><br>Food — To say the national dish is nshima is an understatement — nshima is eaten with Every Single Meal. If it doesn’t have nshima it’s not a meal. People love it. It’s tasteless. It’s eaten by rolling a small amount in your palm and using it to mop up the other food on your plate (which is all called Relish, Kiikaonde: maanyi). It’s widely available, since everyone grows maize (corn) and there’s generally someone with a small mill, whose motor is always humming away. Unfortunately, since it’s literally just corn and water, it’s far from nutritionally complete. Other side dishes make up for this. The most common are pumpkin leaves (kibwawa), tomato soup, cabbage (the cabbage is really good and somehow really consistent across the country), beans (nkunde) and chicken (nzolo). Occasionally eggs (make), fish (masabi), beef (ng’ombe), pork (ngulu), mpwa (firm striped green bitter vegetable-fruits of solanaceae family) mushrooms (boowa) and in the city rice and pasta. Cooking oil (manyi, saladi*) is very important. I’m not sure exactly what it’s used in. 
<br><br>Our market has potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes, beans, small fish called kapenta, barbell fish (milombe), watermelons (kinamunwa/jishombe), cucumbers (kibiimbi), bananas (makonde), sweet potatoes (ntamba), three or four species of mushrooms, ground nuts (nyimu), onions (kanyenze) and sugarcane (mweenge), and various spices, usually in little bags. 
<br><br>The market-block is the heart of the market. The surrounding shops have packaged goods like candy, crisps (chips), beauty products, and soda. There are lots of barber shops and liquor stores. Other shops sell tools, hair extensions, or household items like laundry baskets, tupperware, sponges, brooms, and clothes. Most stores offer very similar if not identical products to each other. Fruiticana is the most popular drink and it’s the best bottled drink I’ve ever had. (It’s like a split between plain fruit juice and a smoothie. It’s very sweet, the main flavors are guava and mango.)

<br><button onclick="toggle8()">LANGUAGE</button>
<div id="kiikaonde">
<br>You can learn a lot about a language’s grammar by paying attention to how its native speakers use English.
<br><br>Despite the claim of my fellow volunteer’s ethnically Bemba native English-speaking girlfriend Kangwa, Zambian English is not identical to British English. I don’t know if this is a widely held belief, but even Kangwa, whose first and only language is English, still speaks with a Zambian accent and uses Zambian turns of phrase.
<br><br>“Footing” to mean “going on foot”
<br><br>That side / this side — “Where is John?” “He’s gone that side.”
<br><br>"If you enter just that country."
<br><br>“Where are you coming from?” to mean “Where are you from?” (And generally a lot of using present continuous when I would not personally opt to use present continuous.) 
<br><br>“Hello” is understood by children as a question whose answer is “Fine, how are you?” (Not my children though.) In Kiikaonde there is no greeting exactly like “hello”.
<br><br>“You’ve knocked off?” — to knock off is to leave from work. Perhaps this is a Britishism.
<br><br>Kiikaonde
<br>Kiikaonde, like all the other Bantu languages in Zambia, uses the English alphabet as its writing system. It works really well. English letters represent sounds far more accurately in Kiikaonde than they do in English. The spelling is entirely phonetic, and, aside from the occasional long versus short vowel distinction, I have no trouble hearing a clearly spoken Kiikaonde word and writing it down, which people are continually impressed by and take as evidence that I’m fluent.
<br><br>I’m not.
<br><br>I can go strong for about 5 sentences. 
<br><br>Kiikaonde is much easier to read than English for those who are just learning to read. 
<br><br>Kiikaonde is not that difficult for me to learn as an English speaker because the grammar is reasonably similar (SVO usually) and the tense system is very intuitive. 
<br><br>I will provide a brief overview of some grammatical and lexical highlights here, but for a more complete introduction, visit this page on my website  ()

<br><button onclick="toggle9()">MY HOUSE</button>
<div id="myhouse">
<br>I love my house.
<br><br>It’s made of large grey bricks that are soft and thick and held in place by an inch of mortar. The inside is plastered with a smooth seemingly termite-resistent stone-like substance which was hastily painted white about four years ago, leaving a few monochromatic Polloc-esque drips on the smooth floor and tails of brush strokes against the metal roof. The roof is held in place simply, but firmly, like all the other buildings here, with two heavy wooden planks that span the width of the house (seven and a half meters) (), on top of which are sheets of simple overlapping sheet metal laid lengthwise from a height of () at its highest to () at its lowest over the length of the house (four and a half meters (). Other houses’ roofs are held in place with bricks, but Peace Corps doesn’t fool around. 
<br><br>The white walls are a perfect canvas, and I’ve started painting solid overlapping rectangles of various colors on the largest wall. Eventually I’ll paint something more imaginative, but it’s so hard to make creative decisions in such a permanent medium. (White paint is only sold in five gallon drums.)
<br><br>The house has what I would describe as two and half rooms: the kitchen vestibule, the living room, and the bed room. Each room has a window which is about one foot wide and one and half feet tall. The windows are framed with wood and secured with two metal bars, a layer of blue mesh (added by the original builders), and a layer of mosquito net (added by me because the blue mesh was not sufficient at keeping the bugs out). Through the east and west windows I’ve run my solar panel cables, one for the solar lamp, and one for the large battery.  
<br><br>Between the bedroom and the kitchen vestibule, there’s a little hole where I put my solar lamp when I’m reading in bed. 
<br><br>Essential features of the house: mosquito net, big rug, water filter, water buckets, and broom bristles duct taped to the door to keep the bugs out.
<br><br>On the roof is a medium-sized solar panel, which is connected to a charge controller, which is connected to a battery, which is connected to a DC inverter which I use to charge my laptop and phone.  
<br><br>Outside, around the whole yard is a fence which my neighbors built last year before I arrived. I’m very grateful for the fence. When the grasses are cut low, the fence provides privacy from the street about fifty feet away and from neighboring houses, to some degree. It’s a well-built fence, but has fallen down in the two places where it lies under guava trees. The deterioration has little to do with the guava trees and more to do with the children who use the fence to climb the guava trees. 
<br><br>Within the fence are three structures besides my house. The largest is the kinzanza, an open brick building (a cooking hut) where I put my stove and where children come to read and draw. The second and third are the bathroom and the shower, which are exactly as large as they need to be. 
<br><br>After the first week I removed the metal roof from the shower and made a bike shed out of it. The roof was about at my shoulder height, and it wasn’t like there was anything important to keep dry in there anyway. 
<br><br>Other than providing a platform for the solar panels, my roof has one very important function. It’s perfect for collecting rainwater.
<br><br>Before I arrived, my neighbors used to place their buckets directly under the edge of the roof at any stable place along its width, where rainwater collects into the narrow channels of the sheet metal and runs down the length of the house, either collecting in the buckets or leaving a series of pock marks in the dirt. During a heavy storm in the rainy season, you could fill anywhere a whole bucket, if the storm lasted more than an hour.
<br><br>After about a month, I went to the nearby town and bought a piece of sheet metal with the same wavy pattern as the pieces that make up the roof (it’s the only kind of sheet metal there is) and had a guy with a power saw cut into thin strips which I took home and tied to the edge of my roof at an angle to allow water to be collected from the entire area of the roof rather than a thin cross section, and channel onto two spots on the ground, where a bucket will fill up within five to eight minutes of heavy rain. My neighbors were confused at first, but eventually caught on, and now buckets will appear in a queue near the drop spot when clouds gather on the horizon. I haven’t had to fetch water from the well in three months. It’s epic. Dry season is going to suck. 
<br><br>I don’t struggle with termites as much as other volunteers, but sometimes crazy leaning towers emerge from a crack in the floor. 
<br><br></div>
    
<br><button onclick="toggle10()">DAILY ROUTINE</button>
<div id="daily">
<br>On a typical day, I wake up around 7:00, read for a bit and then make breakfast, get water out of my water filter and take my malaria prophylaxis. I usually wind up at school around 8:00, which is when the majority of the children have arrived and settled.  
<br><br>Sometimes, randomly all the other teachers are at a meeting in the boma and there’s two or three dedicated primary teachers. Other days it’s like “it’s a celebration day” for various reasons and I abandon the slim hope I had of getting any work done.   
<br><br>But most days I teach the lesson topics I prepared the previous evening, then the kids beg for me to stay and I feel like staying anyway so I teach another subject of their choice, but then they get restless and I go to another class.
<br><br>Then I come home and have lunch and entertain the neighboring kids, who come from far and wide to witness my antics, color, draw, and play. I’m very happy to report that after a few months, the kids who live closer to me know more English than those who live further away. Who knows how effective my methods are, but it’s good to know that they are at least a little effective.
<br><br>After lunch I immediately collapse on the floor where I lay until I’ve fully recovered my forgotten moral senses and I don’t care any tuppances for any consequences () and if anyone disturbs me I pretend I only speak English.
<br><br>After that the routine varies, so in the evening I do some combination of: write, read, cook, listen to podcasts, clean the house, explore, build something, exercise, play with the kids, teach random community members who come asking for a grammar lesson, play the ukulele, study language, play solitaire, collect bottle caps with kids, walk around the community and try to meet people, work on the dictionary, code my video game, draw, go to the boma to shop or watch YouTube videos, or hang out with my resource family. (Recently I’ve been teaching them how to play chess and Spades.)

<br><button onclick="toggle11()">END NOTES</button>
<div id="end">
<br><br>While I’ve endeavored to be factual in my report, please take the things I’ve said so far with a grain of salt, and know also that this is only one person’s experience with one village. Other volunteers have already had wildly different experiences, although there are many broad common themes. The people who live here, and who grew up here, also have their own perspectives and associations, which differ vastly from mine. 
<br><br>Most of the things I’ve observed have been slowly accumulated through interaction and passive observation. If I weren’t preoccupied with food and bodily well-being, I would probably have observed a lot more and gotten more work done at school. The former two things obviously take precedence, so I’m not really blaming myself. I also try not to impose by asking too many questions or pushing too hard for change. People share a lot with me already and make a lot of accommodations, and I try not to pester them.
<br><br>All-in-all, I think my village is not very different from any other rural place in the world, or in North Carolina. The people are people, there are shy ones, gossips, stoics, and tricksters. The children are children: unwise, clumsy, and full of snot, but also natural scientists, avid language learners, and soooooooooo cute. The breeze sways the trees, the clouds billow, the birds sing. Economics drives behavior, people cook and talk about nothing, the hand of global capitalism is visible as a thin string connecting Gucci-branded backpacks to factories in countries no one here has heard of, and there are hidden patterns that mostly go ignored, but which will unfold themselves to those who are curious and listen.
