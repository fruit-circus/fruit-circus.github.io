<div class="title"><b>Chasm Row</b></div>
<div class="text">


There is a place called chasm row
<br>where no one bright attempts to go
<br>a place where clinging vapors slime— 
<br>where greying coasts are gripped with grime.

<br><br>There is a place called chasm row
<br>where choking rodents come and go
<br>where seaweed is the only food
<br>and where the clinging goblins brood.

<br><br>The things that live in chasm row
<br>are not things I would like to know
<br>their veins are grey from griming dust
<br>and that’s some stuff I do not trust.

<br><br>There’s whack-ass shit in chasm row,
<br>it’s made of rocks and winds that blow
<br>it’s full of things that blink too much,
<br>that scream and have no sense of touch.

<br><br>And stealing through the grey-ish land
<br>there is a feral children’s band
<br>with busted flutes, a broken bass
<br>(it’s not the greatest choral space).

<br><br>How they arrived, I do not know,
<br>I found them where the dead things go. 
<br>And as I learned atop their pier,
<br>they bite you if you get too near.

<br><br>In any case, they have new drums
<br>to smash the Gringler when he comes.
<br>A triangle, bows, some pots and pans.
<br>I doubt they’ve read my lesson plans.
