<br>The April Heat (Scooping slimy algae off the underside of a boat, slick soft.) The sight of a boy beating his wings above the water.
<br>(The lapping water, the cutting sun.) Wings, sick, slicing the air.
<br>Being beaten.
<br>(The hand dipping down beneath the surface to touch my face.)
<br>How is a mirror like a shield? (The sun turns the water living green.)
<br>A shield reflects light. (The moon is a shield.)
<br>A knife 刀 is just a thing that makes division 分. (The sun, from a genetic point of view, is one of the largest knives, as it creates displacements in the tides.)
<br>The something-tides*, he explains.
<br>In the living room, he asks: what’s it like to live in the shallows? (Where he could reach in and grab me by the shoulders and divide me from the water. Those 力 powerful wings.) It feels terrible paralytic. 
<br>On the rocks, he can see it all laid out as a flat plane. This maze of coral in the tide pool: does it create, as it creates a maze? Or does it destroy an otherwise solid body of water? Or does it liberate the rock from solidity?
<br>The living room overlooks the sea. I can agree that a cut is the creation of a division, and the disruption of a nucleotide is the same as the creation of a new sequence of nucleotides.
<br>But why is power so tied to hurt 伤? Why is beating the only way to fly 飞? My separation from the nearby tide pool—an unlodging—is it a division?
<br>Or a creation? His wing beats answer in the other room: disease (飞), disease (疒), disease (力), disease (伤).
