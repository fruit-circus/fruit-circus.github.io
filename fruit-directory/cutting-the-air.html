<br>The April Heat (Scooping slimy algae off the underside of a boat,
<br>slick soft.) The sight of a boy beating his wings above the water.
<br>(The lapping water, the cutting sun.) Wings, sick, slicing the air.
<br>Being beaten. (The hand dipping down beneath the surface to touch
<br>my face.) How is a mirror like a shield? (The sun turns the water
<br>living green.) A shield reflects light. (The moon is a shield.)
<br>A knife 刀 is just a thing that makes division 分. (The sun,
<br>from a genetic point of view, is one of the largest knives,
<br>as it creates displacements in the tides.) The something-tides*,
<br>he explains. In the living room, he asks: what’s it like to live
<br>in the shallows? (Where he could reach in and grab me by the shoulders
<br>and divide me from the water. Those 力 powerful wings.) It feels terrible
<br>paralytic. On the rocks, he can see it all laid out as a flat plane.
<br>This maze of coral in the tide pool: does it create, as it creates a maze?
<br>Or does it destroy an otherwise solid body of water? Or does it liberate the rock
<br>from solidity? The living room overlooks the sea. I can agree that a cut
<br>is the creation of a division, and the disruption of a nucleotide is the same
<br>as the creation of a new sequence of nucleotides. But why is power so tied
<br>to hurt 伤? Why is beating the only way to fly 飞?
<br>My separation from the nearby tide pool—an unlodging—is it a division?
<br>Or a creation? His wing beats answer in the other room:
<br>disease (飞), disease (疒), disease (力), disease (伤).
