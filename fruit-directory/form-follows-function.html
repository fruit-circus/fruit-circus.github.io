<div class="title">Meet the Jorksons<br>
    Episode 3: Form Follows Function</div>

    <br><br>INT. AN OLD CASTLE.

    <br><br>TECH, a small, melancholy thirteen year-old, and ROBBIE, a normal, semi-circular child, are in an old castle fighting unarmed, empty suits of armor. They are hitting the suits with broomsticks. (Bang, clang, etc.)
    
    <br><br>TECH: Let us! Show you! Our! Tickets!
    
    <br><br>Tech topples another suit of armor. 
    
    <br><br>TECH: We're just here for the Marmalade Exhibit!
    
    <br><br>ROBBIE: ArugulaaaaaAAA!
    
    <br><br>UMBRELLA KID, Tech and Robbie’s younger sibling, and LILY, Tech’s human friend, run in from around the corner carrying armfuls of ancient books. 
    
    <br><br>BOUNCE, a normal dog, slides along the floor behind the children dragged by his leash as if the floor were frictionless, smashing into all of the walls.
    
    <br><br>UMBRELLA KID: Aim for the head, you sad, sad old man!
    
    <br><br>Tech hits the suit again, sending its helmet spinning clockwise like a grogger after H*****. It falls into a pile of identical suits with an aluminum clang.
    
    <br><br>TECH (exhausted): We really. We really do have tickets.
    
    <br><br>One of the fallen suits stifles a sneeze.
    
    <br><br>EVERYONE: Gesundheit.
    
    <br><br>INT. THE JORKSONS’ KITCHEN.
    
    <br><br>BECK and NEW WEBSTER’S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY are sitting at the kitchen table. New Webster is reading a newspaper, whose headline is "HELLO!"
    
    <br><br>BECK: There will be a Home-owner’s Association meeting.
    
    <br><br>NEW WEBSTER (concerned): What is that?
    
    <br><br>BECK gestures to the ORB. The Orb PULSES VIOLENTLY.
    
    <br><br>BECK: There have been “noise complaints.” Some of the neighbors think that there is noise. Not always, but sometimes. Noise happens when air is compressed. I think the Orb compresses the air. 
    
    <br><br>The Orb PULSES again. A glass shatters.
    
    <br><br>NEW WEBSTER: I don’t understand why the Orb needs to be addressed.
    
    <br><br>BECK: You don't understand the orb?
    
    <br><br>NEW WEBSTER: There's a relationship between air and the orb that I think is important.
    
    <br><br>BECK: The Home-owner’s Association does not think that.
    
    <br><br>Beck takes the pepper shaker and the Orb drops apart.
    
    <br><br>A LAUGH TRACK plays.
    
    <br><br>BECK: Hm.
    
    <br><br>The Orb parts reassemble themselves, and continue PULSING, shattering New Webster’s tea cup as he attempts to take a drink and shattering the plate that Beck’s croissant is on as she attempts to take the croissant off it. They continue in silence as if nothing is happening.
    
    <br><br>NEW WEBSTER: “Tranquil,” four letters?
    
    <br><br>BECK: Hmmm.
    
    <br><br>Her coffee cup shatters.
    
    <br><br>BECK: Calm. Damn.
    
    <br><br>INT. CASTLE.
    
    <br><br>The children rush up and down several flights of stairs and peek inside a series of rooms that are increasingly not the Marmalade Exhibit.
    <br><br>Umbrella Kid opens the door on a room full of slowly rotating lamps.
    <br><br>Tech opens a door to a room full of other open doors.
    <br><br>Robbie opens a door to a single POTTED FERN. He stares blankly at the fern.
    <br><br>Tech opens a door on a room that drops off into a deep, dark chasm. The walls move like insects.
    
    <br><br>TECH (annoyed): Ugh! This is <i>not</i> the Marmalade Exhibit.
    
    <br><br>Umbrella Kid opens a door on a room full of slightly different rotating lamps.
    
    <br><br>Lily opens a door on two suits of armor having a tea party. They both turn to look at her.
    
    <br><br>LILY: Oh gosh! I’m so sorry.
    
    <br><br>She closes the door and leans against it.
    
    <br><br>LILY: Ohh. That was so awkward.
    
    <br><br>Robbie stands outside a door hesitantly, and then bursts in. The fern is in exactly the same place as it was before. Which makes Robbie sad.
    
    <br><br>Bounce opens a door by standing in front of it and vibrating. The door swings open to reveal another, identical Bounce. Both Bounces’ hind legs begin to float, as gravity is negated.
    
    <br><br>LILY: Okay. Okay... think: Marmalade Exhibit. Think... marmalade.
    
    <br><br>The door opens to the same two suits of armor. One is giving the other a massage while it lies on a chiropractor’s table. They both look at Lily.
    
    <br><br>LILY: Oh God! I’m so sorry! I — gosh, I...ah!
    
    <br><br>She closes the door.
    
    <br><br>LILY: HHHHHHHHHH...
    
    <br><br>INT. — THE CASTLE HALL.
    
    <br><br>TECH: Anyone?
    
    <br><br>LILY: No luck.
    
    <br><br>TECH: I don’t get it. The map says it’s on this floor.
    
    <br><br>Just then, in the other room, the Bounces collide, merging. They pop like balloons. With a fizzle, the children are standing in a gallery with framed POSTERS of marmalade, informational PLAQUES about marmalade, JARS of different types of marmalade on pedestals, and ten to twelve gallery patrons wearing marmalade-themed HATS and carrying marmalade-themed HANDBAGS.
    
    <br><br>LILY: YES! (She hugs Tech in excitement.) It looks like all we had to do was believe in it hard enough!
    
    <br><br>TECH (blushing): Yeah, haha! Hey, there’s the plaque about quinces.
    
    <br><br>INT. AN ATRIUM.

    <br><br> A few dozen people are mingling, creating indistinct CONVERSATION in a large glass-walled room. There is a table with CHEESE and FRUIT. This is a Home-owner’s Association meeting.
    
    <br><br> A door manifests in the middle of the cheese table, destroying it. There are two loud thuds, and the final Jorkson, MISTER, in a top hat and three-piece suit, neither animal nor mineral, enters through the door, followed by Beck and New Webster.
    
    <br><br> Mister opens their mouth and there is a PROLONGED SCREECH OF RENDING METAL.
        
    <br><br> NEW WEBSTER: Is this the Home-owner’s Association?
    
    <br><br> The LAUGH TRACK plays.

    <br><br> BECK: No, I’m not sure.
    
    <br><br> Beck stands on the table.
    
    <br><br> BECK: Attention, noise-hearers. I have brought the ORB.
    
    <br><br> The Orb floats out from the door and oscillates randomly above Beck, changing color with violent intent and glitching out of shape.
    
    <br><br> The Jorkson children -- Tech, Robbie, and Umbrella Kid -- and Lily arrive in the door wearing “I opened a dimensional doorway into the Marmalade Exhibit and all I got was this T-shirt and the experience of a lifetime” T-shirts.
    
    <br><br> BECK: We have the Orb completely under control. The Orb can now do tricks. Observe. Orb! Sit!
    
    <br><br> The Orb PULSES VIOLENTLY and the entire room VIBRATES like an elastic band.
    
    <br><br> BECK: Orb! Stop doing that.
    
    <br><br> The Orb explodes and reforms. Time distends like hot taffy. The room flashes yellow. The home-owners clutch their ears against the vibrations, rattling blast like microphone feedback.
    
    <br><br> BECK: Bad Orb! Roll over! Roll over for treat!
    
    <br><br> From the crowd, Tech looks at Bounce, a normal dog, who is pulling against the leash, as if drawn magnetically to the Orb. The leash doesn’t break.
    
    <br><br>TECH: Oh no! The leash broke!
    
    <br><br> The leash, which had missed its queue, snaps in half lengthwise like a cheese-stick. Bounce stares blankly at the children, then evaporates.
    
    <br><br> The tumult grows unbearable even for the Jorksons: chthonic, orotund, piercing and round like a jet engine. Lily and all of the home-owners topple onto the floor. Bounce (dog-shaped) appears above the Orb, mouth open.
    
    <br><br> TECH (clutching her ears): BOUNCE! You can’t just keep eating our problems!
    
    <br><br>BOUNCE: Tech. Tech. Tech Jorkson. We are your denouement. We are the last word in your poem. We are your <i>un</i>raveling and your raveling. We are the name of every ending. We are a good boy. We are a good boy and we deserve a snack.
    
    <br><br> Bounce is a mandala spiraling around the Orb, room-filling, unfolding crystalline, entropic. The bounces coalesce in a lateral sweep and ringing silence clears in the room. Bounce consumes the Orb.
    
    <br><br> TECH (empathetic): Ugh. Bounce!
    
    <br><br> BECK: Revel in the supreme domesticity of the Orb!
    
    <br><br> NEW WEBSTER (aside to Mister): I still don’t understand what a Home-owner’s Association is.
    
    <br><br> The suits of armor have stolen the cheese table.
    
    <br><br> THE END.
