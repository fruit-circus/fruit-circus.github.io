<div class="title"><b>I Believed Satan was Some Kind of Large Wild Dog Until I was Ten</b></div>
<div class="text">

        When we were seven,
        <br>you whispered that Satan loves onion grass.
        <br>He gnashes up the green stalks and swallows
        <br>the fruiting bodies whole.
        <br>At evening, we trowled a hole under the bracken.
        <br>We were together
        <br>in the heat of summer sidewalks exhaling.
        <br>We ducked under the green curtains
        <br>on hands and knees, and went to work
        <br>on the red dirt. We left him a smelly, stalky offering
        <br>and got dirt in our fingernails.
        <br>I put on a brave face; I always played the skeptic.
        <br>But I was secretly too afraid of Satan
        <br>to smooth the last of the soil. (Could he smell me?)
        <br>You said: that’s the most important part,
        <br>and the next morning
        <br>there was a single mashed up onion left.
        
        <br><br>I’ve been thinking about how small
        <br>that forest room was. And how,
        <br>because no adult
        <br>could cram in comfortably,
        <br> I never knew if an animal had dug
        <br>the onions up that night,
        <br>or if you had snuck from your dark house
        <br>in the red morning
        <br>and snuck them away
        <br>to trick me.
        <br>You were always the angry one.
        <br>I love that. But I wonder
        <br>what you were thinking that morning.
        <br>I wonder if the round O
        <br>of onion, or the taste
        <br>of the curvy moon
        <br>made you smile.
