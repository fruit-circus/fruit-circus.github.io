<div class="title"><b>I Believed Satan was Some Kind of Large Wild Dog Until I was Ten</b></div>
<div class="text">

        When we were seven, and days didn’t matter,
        <br>you whispered that Satan loves onion grass. He gnashes
        <br>up the green stalks and swallows
        <br>the fruiting bodies whole. That night
        <br>we trowled a hole under the bracken, and we were together
        <br> in the heat of summer sidewalks exhaling. We
        <br> clasped the green curtains and went to work
        <br>on the red dirt. We left him a smelly, stalky offering
        <br>and got dirt in our fingernails.
        <br>I was too afraid of Satan
        <br>to smooth the last of the soil. (Could he smell me?)
        <br>You said, that’s the most important part,
        <br>and the next morning
        <br>there was a single mashed up onion left.
        
        <br><br>I’ve been thinking about how small that forest room
        <br>was. And how, because no adult
        <br>could cram in comfortably,
        <br> I never knew if an animal had dug
        <br>the onions up that night,
        <br>or if you had snuck from your dark house
        <br>in the red morning
        <br>and put them in the river.
        <br>You were always the angry one,
        <br> and I love that. But I wonder
        <br>what you were thinking that morning.
        <br>I wonder if the round O
        <br>of onion, or the taste
        <br> of the curvy moon
        <br> made you smile.
