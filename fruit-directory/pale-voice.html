Last night, you dreamed there was a hole in your room.
<br>It went straight through your carpet, deep into the soil.
<br>The earth was warm—it radiated warmth—and to look into it
<br>felt like nestling into a pile of fresh laundry, or new mulch.
<br>You were almost sure there were angels at the bottom, flapping around
<br>in the blue. There was one in particular who sounded like your mom,
<br>hand bell choir voice resounding phonic ophanim. It was almost her,
<br>but her body was pale and hollow, like sky. Dreams
<br>are pretty weird sometimes, huh?
