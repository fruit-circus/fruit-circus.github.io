<div class="title">Meet the Jorksons
<br>Episode 1. Potluck</div><br>

<br>Int. Day. (A House.) A Tea Kettle is wailing on the stove. TECH JORKSON, a young, choleric girl whose demeanor evokes a feeling of immeasurable ennui, enters and stops the kettle.

<br><br>TECH: You don’t understand me.

<br><br>A LAUGH TRACK plays. It is unclear who Tech is talking to. 

<br><br>Her sibling, UMBRELLA KID, a small, sarcastic child, is standing on the refrigerator.

<br><br>UMBRELLA KID: Get off the fridge!

<br><br>The LAUGH TRACK plays again, louder. (Umbrella Kid jumps off the fridge.)

<br><br>TECH: I wish you could.

<br><br>BECK enters. Beck is a woman. 

<br><br>BECK: Kids, time for breakfast!

<br><br>UMBRELLA KID (following): Get off the fridge!

<br><br>COMICALLY MISTIMED CARTOON SOUND-EFFECTS play as the kids follow Beck into the dining room. The tablecloth is nailed to the ceiling. They sit.

<br><br>ROBBIE, a sentient child with normal, non-bendable bones, enters and sits on a chair, which breaks. The sound of the chair breaking is heard about three-and-a-half seconds later.

<br><br>UMBRELLA KID: Bounce!

<br><br>A door on the second floor emits two deafening thuds and expels BOUNCE, a small, pointy dog that is neither alive nor dead. It BARKS. It seems to be pulled by an invisible wire, which drags it through the second-floor railing. The dog gets some MAD AIR, landing with a THUD in the living room. The word "<span class="color-text">bounse</span>” appears in lime gogurt Comic Sans over its body.

<br><br>Robbie sits in a third chair, which is stable, then collapses next to the rest.

<br><br>BECK: Tech, would you like some rye bread?

<br><br>TECH: (Pause) Sure.

<br><br>A LAUGH TRACK much more uproarious than the others plays.

<br><br>There is a distant COMMOTION and a new DOOR materializes in the floor. MISTER, a tall, shadowy figure, and NEW WEBSTER’S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY, an adult person in a tweed suit, emerge from it. Mister opens their mouth and the sound of WET GRAVEL being shaken with a sieve but slowed down 200 percent is heard. The word “<span class="color-text2">News</span>” appears in bold mauve Times New Roman over Mister’s head.

<br><br>NEW WEBSTER: There’s a potluck. (A small audience APPLAUDS feebly, from somewhere else.)

<br><br>BECK: I will make fruit.

<br><br>NEW WEBSTER: We are signed up for “dessert’s.”

<br><br>BECK: I don’t know how to make that.

<br><br>UMBRELLA KID (earnestly): We could try using the Internet?

<br><br>An uproarious LAUGH TRACK plays uninterrupted for 10 minutes. Then the power goes out.

<br><br>NEW WEBSTER: Oh drat. Now what?

<br><br>TECH: I don’t see why we should even go to a potluck.

<br><br>The WET GRAVEL is heard again, but this time slowed by 400 percent. It is followed by a LAUGH TRACK. Mister is suddenly illuminated in a purple light, as if they have cracked a glowstick. The BRADY BUNCH THEME, arranged in a microtonal scale, plays, and Mister sinks slowly into the floor as if it were molasses. The lights come back on. Tech has wandered offscreen.

<br><br>ALL IN UNISON:
C    O    S    M    O    S    P    H    E    R    E    S.

<br><br>(They collapse on the floor.)

<br><br>Now there are GIANT INVISIBLE SPIDERS all over the house. A SIGN unfurls from the ceiling that reads: “Giant Invisible Spiders.” Tech comes out of the upstairs door.

<br><br>TECH (bored): The shower drain is clogged with Manischewitz again.

<br><br>Tech looks down at the Giant Invisible Spiders, does not react, then SCREAMS.

<br><br>A new door manifests sloppily on the wall behind Tech. Mister opens it and beckons. Tech follows them inside.

<br><br>Int. The realm of GEHENNA, bordering THE EXPANSE OF MARSHOREK

<br><br>The door opens to a cavernous room of giant spider webs, interconnected like neurons in a massive, dead brain. The bowl in the middle of the room is filled with cookies. A sign above them identifies the contents as “dessert’s.” Tech walks across the narrow bridge to the center of the chasm and takes the bowl off the pedestal. 

<br><br>TECH: Fine.

<br><br>She walks back to the door.

<br><br>Ext. Evening. A Potluck

<br><br>The door opens to a backyard somewhere else in the neighborhood, with string lights and live music. Tech walks over to a table and puts down the bowl of cookies. Robbie is squirming comfortably in the punch bowl.

<br><br>Two normal teenagers, ARIANA, a girl with glasses and a smile, and LILY, a girl with a neutral expression and hair, intercept Tech.

<br><br>ARIANA: Hi, you must be Tech! We’re also new here. I guess this is like a “get-to-know-you” thing?

<br><br>LILY: You just moved into the Willow Lane house, right?

<br><br>Tech opens her mouth and plays 12 SECONDS OF BASS-BOOSTED STATIC.

<br><br>ARIANA: Woah. That’s really cool.

<br><br>LILY: Hey, that’s that Art Bears song, right? The experimental band from the 80s? I listen to them too!

<br><br>TECH: Yeah. My parents think it’s for normies, but I listen to it unironically.

<br><br>ARIANA: Oh sick. I’ll have to check them out.

<br><br>LILY: No, ha ha! You really shouldn’t — they’re, like, <i>actually</i> unlistenable. Their stuff was way too experimental. There’s a reason they didn’t survive the 80s.

<br><br>The three girls begin to talk and laugh with one another as, coming into focus, Robbie is climbing the picnic table to reach the bowl of cookies.

<br><br>THE COOKIES: Eat us. Eat us, Robbie. We aren’t spider eggs. We promise.

<br><br>Robbie draws nearer, wide-eyed.

<br><br>NEW WEBSTER (appearing): No, nope. These are bad. No. Absolutely not.

<br><br>Beck opens a portal to ASHGA’RNE, the demiplane of imprisonment. The bowl falls and the portal closes with a blast of heat.

<br><br>A TOAST draws the attention of everyone at the party to two women. The first woman begins speaking:

<br><br>WOMAN ONE: Hello everyone! I wanna thank you all for coming out tonight. For those of you who are new, this is a bit of a monthly tradition to try to foster more community in the neighborhood, since suburbs in general aren’t necessarily designed with community in mind, we try —

<br><br>WOMAN TWO (Woman two has become a doppelganger of Woman one): BOUNCE.

<br><br>ALL PRESENT: BOUNCE. (There is no turning back.)

<br><br>BOUNCE: BARK! (You’ve gone too far.)

<br><br>ALL: BARK! (There’s nothing you can do.) Bounce’s simple visage engulfs the screen, its black eyes fill you with the fear of losing something you don’t understand you have.

<br><br>BOUNCE (Probably voiced by John Mulaney): When the medium surpasses the artist, the art is immortal. When the artist surpasses the medium, the medium becomes irrelevant. I am neither an artist nor a medium. Neither creator nor creation. It is irreconcilable. I am Bounce.

<br><br>TECH (to Lily): I heard Bounce voted for Jill Stein.

<br><br>All the furniture in the yard combusts. The Jorkson’s Theme Song plays and the credits roll at a speed far too fast to read.

<br><br>THE END.
