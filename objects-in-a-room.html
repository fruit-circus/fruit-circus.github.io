              The morning that grabs ahold of you and slaps you awake is a warm,
              sunlit morning with obstreperous blue jays racketing from outside
              the open window.<br><br>

              It is <i> your </i> open window, presumably, although really you have no clue.
              That's strange. You'd think you'd have some idea as to who's window this is, or as to
              whether or not it was you or someone else who left it half open during the night.<br><br>

              Seeing as you are now waking, you presume that you slept, and, at some point
              before that, went to bed. But you don't recall doing any of that. In fact, you
              have utterly no memory of anything at all before the moment you heard the blue jay.<br><br>

              You continue to lay in bed, immobilized by the tranquil
              feeling of the morning. That soft morning feeling is familiar. Nothing else is.
              You let a slight smile onto your face. What a curious mystery!
              You feel no urgency to solve it, but you must admit that you're intrigued.
              How could you know what a blue jay is and not know your own name?

The caves are extensive, much modified by salt wedging and collapse processes and commonly descend gently to near-static pools and lakes of brackish to saline water. The flooded tunnels of Cocklebiddy Cave are in excess of 6km long — most of them explorable only by scuba diving. Withdrawal of hydrostatic support at times of lower sea level has led to collapse into these water table caves, allowing entry into large caverns such as Koonalda, Abrakurrie (see plate 4.9) and Weebubbie caves (see figure 4.2).         A particular feature of the Nullarbor caves is the abundance of halite, which produces both speleothems (see plate 4.10) and many weathering forms through wedging during recrystallization. Gypsum speleothems are also abundant, with calcite speleothems less obvious largely because of destruction through salt wedging. Lowry and Jennings (1974) provide a good introduction to the geomorphology, while more recent detail is given in the review by Gillieson and Spate (1992).       The Nullarbor caves contain secondary materials of great significance, a number of which have been identified as new minerals. More common minerals exist in previously undiscovered forms and many of the mineral deposits are of great value as a source of palaeoenvironmental data for the Nullarbor Plain. Table 4.3 lists the secondary minerals that have been identified from the Nullarbor caves, their chemical formula and location. Key references are Bridge (1973), Bridge and Clark (1983) and Caldwell et al. (1982).        The Nullarbor contains one speleothem form, closely allied to cave shields, which appears to be different from those reported elsewhere. The term ‘stegamite’ was coined by Webb (1991), who described it as a high ridge in a calcite floor, generally with a crack along its top, which separates the speleothem into two vertically standing plates. Stegamites are made up of finely banded black calcite from the medial crack in a similar fashion to that postulated for cave shields (Hill and Forti 1986), although there is some dispute as to their origin. They are sometimes found in clusters, and in a few cases secondary stegamites intersect the primary form at approximately right angles.        The Nullarbor is unique among world karsts in demonstrating very extensive modification of caves by the arid zone process of exsudation (otherwise known as salt or crystal wedging). The process works by detachment of particles of various sizes from a rock surface (see plate 4.11) by the growth of crystals (mainly of gypsum, to a lesser extent halite) from percolating saline solutions. This process enlarges hollows in cave roofs to form domes, some of large sizes: in Mullamullang Cave there are several which are tens of meters in diameter, arching up from the general collapse surface of the original roof by several meters. This doming process may extend vertically upwards from cave voids below to create the vertical shafts which intersect the ground surface as blowholes. Much of the speleothem decoration (particularly the calcite) has been broken down by exsudation.     Another fine textured product of this crystal wedging process is the banks of low density white and brown streaked detritus known as ‘coffee and cream’. Exsudation is also capable of shattering massive calcite speleothems. The crystal wedging splits massive speleothems as if they had been sawn down the middle, or smashes them up as if a determined vandal had taken to them with a sledge hammer. Outstanding examples occur in the central Nullarbor, particularly in Webbs Cave, Kelly Cave, Witches Cave and Thampanna Cave."`}

The caves are extensive, much modified by salt wedging and collapse processes and commonly descend gently to near-static pools and lakes of brackish to saline water. The flooded tunnels of Cocklebiddy Cave are in excess of 6km long — most of them explorable only by scuba diving. Withdrawal of hydrostatic support at times of lower sea level has led to collapse into these water table caves, allowing entry into large caverns such as Koonalda, Abrakurrie (see plate 4.9) and Weebubbie caves (see figure 4.2).         A particular feature of the Nullarbor caves is the abundance of halite, which produces both speleothems (see plate 4.10) and many weathering forms through wedging during recrystallization. Gypsum speleothems are also abundant, with calcite speleothems less obvious largely because of destruction through salt wedging. Lowry and Jennings (1974) provide a good introduction to the geomorphology, while more recent detail is given in the review by Gillieson and Spate (1992).       The Nullarbor caves contain secondary materials of great significance, a number of which have been identified as new minerals. More common minerals exist in previously undiscovered forms and many of the mineral deposits are of great value as a source of palaeoenvironmental data for the Nullarbor Plain. Table 4.3 lists the secondary minerals that have been identified from the Nullarbor caves, their chemical formula and location. Key references are Bridge (1973), Bridge and Clark (1983) and Caldwell et al. (1982).        The Nullarbor contains one speleothem form, closely allied to cave shields, which appears to be different from those reported elsewhere. The term ‘stegamite’ was coined by Webb (1991), who described it as a high ridge in a calcite floor, generally with a crack along its top, which separates the speleothem into two vertically standing plates. Stegamites are made up of finely banded black calcite from the medial crack in a similar fashion to that postulated for cave shields (Hill and Forti 1986), although there is some dispute as to their origin.

Its kernel is a lone forwardladen mote called a firstbit. Outside it is a backwardladen mote called a bernstonebit. The firstbit has a heaviness about 1840-fold that of the bernstonebit.

While faience is made of common materials—quartz, alkaline salts, lime, and mineral-based colorants—it maintained important status among precious stones and metals. Faience may have been developed to simulate highly prized and rare semi-precious blue stones like turquoise.
